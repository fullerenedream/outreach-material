Resources about Sodium-cooled Fast Reactors
===========================================

Professor Lee pointed me to this paper way back in the day and to this day it still summarizes the bulk of what a
sodium-cooled fast reactor designer should know about. Anyone who knows this stuff really well can easily get a job
in SFRs:

R. N. Hill, D. C. Wade, J. R. Liaw & E. K. Fujita (1995) Physics Studies of Weapons Plutonium Disposition in the
Integral Fast Reactor Closed Fuel Cycle, Nuclear Science and Engineering, 121:1, 17-31, DOI: 10.13182/NSE121-17

In fact, there's a whole Special Edition of *Progress in Nuclear Energy* discussing key details of the IFR. The
articles on safety and fuel are absolute classics.

For neutronics methods, Professor Yang wrote an excellent summary called "FAST REACTOR PHYSICS AND COMPUTATIONAL
METHODS" www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201211666470425.page

Of course, there is the classic textbook, Fast Breeder Reactors, by Alan Waltar. It was updated as Fast Spectrum
Reactors in 2011 and is back in print, though it's quite expensive. See if you can find it in the library.

The original 1981 edition is very good and covers most things. It's only missing the excellent advanced in metallic fuel
that were.
