        These values are highly uncertain estimates, can change with new exploration.
        The uranium number includes known resources used in breeders. If seawater-dissolved
        uranium is used, the value would be several orders of magnitude higher. Renewables
        are limited by the total energy content of the Sun and will be computed and added 
        later.
